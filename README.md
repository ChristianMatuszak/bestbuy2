# BestBuy Inventory System

## Description
This project simulates a simple inventory system for an online store. It includes two main classes:

- **`Product`**: Manages products, including their prices and quantities in stock.
- **`Store`**: Manages a list of products and allows users to add or remove products, make orders, and view the total quantity of products in the store.

### Learning Project
This is a **learning project** that demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python. It focuses on creating and managing classes, handling product inventories, and simulating transactions in a store environment.

## Features

### Product Management
- Products can be added or removed from the store.
- The total quantity of all products in the store can be calculated.
- The store displays all available products with current stock and prices.

### Ordering
- Users can place an order by selecting products and specifying quantities.
- The total price of the order is calculated automatically.

## Usage
Run the `main.py` file to interact with the inventory system:

```bash
python main.py
